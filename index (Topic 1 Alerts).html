        <!--alert is a keywordâ€”that is, a word that has special meaning for JavaScript. It means, "Display, in an alert box, the message that follows."
            Note that alert isn't capitalized. If you capitalize it, the script will stop. The parentheses are a special requirement of JavaScript, one that
            you'll soon get used to. You'll be typing parens over and over again, in all kinds of JavaScript statements.-->
        <!--In coding, the quoted text "Thanks for your input!" is called a text string or simply a string. The name makes sense: it's a string of characters
            enclosed in quotes. Outside the coding world, we'd just call it a quotation.-->
        <!--But I want you to know the style conventions of JavaScript, so I'll ask you to always omit spaces before and after parentheses.-->
        <!--Some coders write window.alert instead of, simply, alert. This is a highly formal but perfectly correct way to write it. Most coders prefer the
            short form. We'll stick to the short form in this training.
            some coders would use single rather than double quotation marks. This is legal, as long as it's a matching pair. But in a case like this, I'll\
            ask you to use double quotation marks.-->
