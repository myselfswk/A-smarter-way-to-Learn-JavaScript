            //Suppose you want to simulate the throw of a die. In the simulation, you want it to randomly come up 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The
            // first step is to ask JavaScript to generate a random number. (Well, it's almost random, technically known as pseudo-random,
            // but it's close enough to random for most purposes.)

            //The following code generates a pseudo-random number, with 16 decimal places, ranging from 0.0000000000000000 through
            // 0.9999999999999999 and assigns it to the variable randomNumber.
            var randomNumber = Math.random();
            alert(randomNumber);

            //The function always delivers a 16-place decimal that ranges from 0.0000000000000000 to 0.9999999999999999. We can convert the
            // decimal to an integer by multiplying by one hundred quadrillion (1 followed by 17 zeroes):
            // 0.0000000000000000 * 100000000000000000 = 0
            // 0.7474887706339359 * 100000000000000000 = 7474887706339359
            // 0.9999999999999999 * 100000000000000000 = 9999999999999999

            //Trillions of possible numbers are more than we need in our virtual die throw. We just want six possible numbers, 1 through 6.
            // So instead of multiplying by a hundred quadrillion, our first step is to multiply the giant decimal by 6.
            // 0.0000000000000000 * 6 = 0
            // 0.7474887706339359 * 6 = 4.7474887706339359
            // 0.9999999999999999 * 6 = 5.9999999999999994

            //Intuition may tell you that you can finish the job by rounding, but that doesn't work out mathematically. Because nothing rounds
            // up to 0 and nothing rounds down to 6, the numbers in the middle, which are reached both by rounding up and rounding down, will
            // come up almost twice as often. But we can give all the numbers an equal chance if we add 1 to the result, then round down.
            // Here's the code for our virtual die throw.

            var bigDecimal = Math.random();
            var improvedNo = (bigDecimal * 6) + 1;
            var diceScore = Math.floor(improvedNo);

            alert(diceScore);

            //This is what happens in the code above, line by line:
                // 1. Generates a 16-place decimal and assigns it to the variable bigDecimal.
                // 2. Converts the 16-place decimal to a number ranging from 0.0000000000000000 through 5.9999999999999999, then adds 1,
                // so the range winds up 1.0000000000000000 through 6.9999999999999999. This number is assigned to the variable improvedNum.
                // 3. Rounds the value represented by improvedNum down to the nearest integer that ranges from 1 through 6.
