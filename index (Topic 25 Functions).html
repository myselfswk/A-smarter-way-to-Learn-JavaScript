            // the data you're passing, is called an argument. The function is now more versatile, because the message it displays is no

            //By "declaring it in a function" I mean that you declare the variable explicitly with the keyword var—as opposed to casually
            // introducing it into the function without var.
            //If you decleared two variable with same name (one global & one is local means on function), the varible inside the function
            // has different as the global variable has different all over.
            
            //but if the local variable in the function is assign with the 'return' statement and its return the value to the function, So
            // If we call the function equals to that global variable with the same name as local variable, than both the local and global
            // variables have same values

            //brings us to a question you may be asking:
            //If a function can use a global variable, why do you have to pass a value from an argument to a parameter? Why not just declare a
            // global variable, then have the function use it? Well, you can, but asking functions to work with global variables is asking
            // them to eavesdrop on the main code, and like human eavesdropping, it invites mischief in the form of confusion and unintended
            // consequences. There is no controversy among coders about this. It's always best to pass values explicitly to functions through
            // arguments. Global variables have no place in functions.
