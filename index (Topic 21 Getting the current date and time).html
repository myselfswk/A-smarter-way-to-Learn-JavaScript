            //Your webpage includes a notice telling the user the current local date and time in his particular time zone. But what is the
            // current date and time? Here's how JavaScript finds out.
            var rigthNow = new Date();
            //The statement above creates something called a Date object.
            //Note that JavaScript gets this information from the user's computer. It is only as accurate as the computer's date and
            // time settings.
            alert(rigthNow);  //original date object
            //The Date object may resemble a string, but it isn't one. For example, you can't use methods on it like charAt, indexOf, or slice.
            //If you need the Date object to be a string, you can convert it to one the same way you convert a number to a string.
            var dateToString = rigthNow.toString();
            alert(dateToString); //date object convert into string

            //Most of the time, you'll just want to extract some of the information from the Date object without converting it to a string.

            //the day of the week was represented as "Mon." But when you extract the day of the week from the object, it's represented as
            // a number.
            //. Days are designated by a number from 0 for Sunday through 6 for Saturday. This means that we will need a bit of code to convert
            // it back into a day name like "Mon."
