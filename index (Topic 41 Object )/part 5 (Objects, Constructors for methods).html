            /*I showed you how to attach a function to an object, using the same approach
                you use when you attach a variable to an object. When you attach a variable to an object, it's
                called a property of the object. When you attach a function to an object, it's called a method of the object.*/
            /*If you're creating more than one object with the same pattern of properties and methods,
                it's a convenience to build the method as well as the properties into the constructor function*/

            function Plan(name, price, space, transfer, pages, discountMonth) {
                this.name = name;
                this.price = price;
                this.space = space;
                this.transfer = transfer;
                this.pages = pages;
                this.discountMonth = discountMonth;
                this.calcAnnual = function(precentIfDisc) {
                    var price = this.price;
                    var currDate = new Date();
                    var currMonth = currDate.getMonth();
                    for (var i=0; i<this.discountMonth.length; i++) {
                        if (this.discountMonth[i] === currMonth) {
                            price = this.price * precentIfDisc;
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                    return price * 12;
                }
            }

            /*Things to notice, the beginning of the method definition:
                Like the property definitions above it, the line begins with the keyword this, referring to
                the name of whatever object is being constructed at any given time.
                The next three pieces are the same: a dot, the name of the method, and an equal sign.
                The next piece is different: the keyword function.
                In this case, a single parameter is inside the parentheses, percentIfDisc. This is not a
                parameter that's part of the constructor. It's a parameter of the method that the constructor
                will create for each object. A value is passed to it not when a new object is created using
                the constructor, but when the method, having already been created along with its object
                via the constructor, is called.*/

            var basicPlan = new Plan("Basic", 3.99, 100, 500, 10, [6, 7]);
            var annualPriceForBasic = basicPlan.calcAnnual(0.67);
            alert(annualPriceForBasic);

            /*The main difference between the method definition in the one-off literal object definition
                (no constructor) and the method definition in the constructor function is the first line. In other 
                respects, both definitions are identical.
                This is the first line of a method definition when an object is created on a one-off basis without a constructor:
                    calcAnnual: function(percentIfDisc) {
                This is the first line of a method definition within a constructor:
                    this.calcAnnual = function(percentIfDisc) {*/

            /*There are two other differences. Because in the constructor function the method definition
                begins with an assignment (something = something else), you need a semicolon after the
                closing curly bracket. And no comma is necessary if another property or method definition follows.*/
