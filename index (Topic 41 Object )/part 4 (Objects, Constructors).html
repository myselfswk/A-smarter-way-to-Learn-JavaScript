            >> The function name is capitalized. JavaScript doesn't care whether you do this or not, but
                it's conventional to do it to distinguish constructor functions from regular functions.
            >> Each of the parameter values is assigned to a variable. But the variable is a property
                attached to some object whose name hasn't been specified yet. But don't worry. Just as the
                parameter values will be filled in by the calling code, so will the name of the object.*/
