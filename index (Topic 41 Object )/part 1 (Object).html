                The code begins like any variable definition, with the keyword var, followed by the object name, and then an equal sign.
                But then, instead of a value, there's a curly bracket, whose twin comes at the end of the block.
                Each property begins with a name, followed by a colon, and then a value.
                Each property definition except the last ends with a comma.
                The closingcurly bracket is followed by a semicolon, because of the equal sign in the first line.*/
