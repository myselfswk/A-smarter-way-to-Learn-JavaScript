            // right point. And it serves as the index number of the array, allowing the code to progress through all the elements of the
            // array as the counter increments with each iteration.
            //In the example, I specify that the loop is to run as long as i <= 4. Alternatively, I could have specified i < 5. Either way,
            // since the counter starts at 0, the loop runs 5 times.

            //There are several problems with the for loop example I gave you in the last chapter. The first problem is a potential
            // communication problem. If a match between the user's city and the list of cleanest cities is found, a confirming alert displays.
            // But if there is no match, nothing happens. The user is left in the dark. If no match is found, we need to display an alert saying
            // so. But how do we do that?
            //We do it with a flag. A flag is just a variable that starts out with a default value that you give it, and then is switched to
            // a different value under certain conditions. In our example, let's say this is the flag.

            //This works, but rather than assigning the strings "no" and "yes" to the switch, it's conventional to use the Boolean values
            // false and true.

            //The next problem with our example is that it potentially wastes computing cycles. Suppose on the second loop a match is found
            // and the alert displays. The way the loop is coded, the loop goes on looping all the way to the end. This is unnecessary,
            // since we got our answer in the second loop. The problem is solved with the keyword break.

        <h1>Loops</h1>
        <!--The first line begins with the keyword for.
            The three specifications that define the loop are inside the parentheses.
            1. A variable that counts iterations and also serves as the changing array index is declared and set to a starting value, in
            this case 0.
            2. The limit on the loop is defined. In this case, the loop is to keep running as long as the counter doesn't exceed 4. Since the
            counter, in this case, is starting at 0, the loop will run 5 times.
            3. What happens to the counter at the end of every loop. In this case, the counter is incremented each time.
        -->
        <!--
            The three specifications inside the parentheses are always in the same order:
                1. What to call the counter (usually i) and what number to start it at (typically 0, but you can also assign variable to it)
                2. How many loops to run (in this case, the number of elements in the array)
                3. How to change the counter after each iteration (typically to add 1 each time through)
