        <!--The arithmetic operators I've been using, +, -, *, and /, are undoubtedly familiar to you.-->
        <!--% is the modulus operator. It doesn't give you the result of dividing one number by another. It gives you the remainder when the division
            is executed. If one number divides evenly into another, the modulus operation returns 0.-->
        <!--In JavaScript as in algebra, the ambiguity is cleared up by precedence rules. As in algebra, the rule that applies here is that multiplication
            operations are completed before addition operations.-->
        <!--But you don't have to memorize JavaScript's complex precedence rules. You can finesse the issue by using parentheses to eliminate ambiguity.
            Parens override all the built-in precedence rules. They force JavaScript to complete operations enclosed by parens before completing any other
            operations.-->
        <!--When you use parens to make your intentions clear to JavaScript, it also makes your code easier to grasp, both for other coders and for you when
            you're trying to understand your own code a year down the road.-->
