        <!--Except for the document node, each node is enclosed within another node. The <head>
            and <body> nodes are enclosed within the <html> node. The <div> node is enclosed within
            the <body> node. Two <p> nodes are enclosed within the <div> node. And a text node is
            enclosed within each of the <p> nodes.-->
        <!--When a node is enclosed within another node, we say that the enclosed node is a child of
            the node that encloses it. So, for example, the <div> node is a child of the <body> node.
            Conversely, the <body> node is the parent of the <div> node.-->

            text node is the child of a <p>. Conversely, the document is the parent of <html>, <html> is
            the parent of <head> and <body>, <head> is the parent of <title>, <title> is the parent of a
            text node, and so on. Nodes with the same parent are known as siblings. So, <head> and
            <body> are siblings because < html> is the parent of both. The two <p>'s are siblings because
            <div> is the parent of both.-->

                    <p>This is <em>Important</em>!</p>
                    <p>If you made a chart for this paragraph, you might think that all the text is a child of the p tag
                        node. But remember, every node that is enclosed by another node is the child of the node that
                        encloses it. Since the text node "important" is enclosed by the element node em tag, this
                        particular text node is the child of em tag, not p tag. The text nodes "This is " and "!" as well as
                        the element node em tag are siblings, because they're all enclosed by p tag. They're all children of p tag.</p>
