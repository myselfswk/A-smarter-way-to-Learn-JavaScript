        <!--Most browsers interpret the whitespace that's created by some carriage returns, tabs, and spaces used to format the code
            as text nodes. When you look at the markup, you see 3 text nodes, the children of the title element and of the two 
            paragraph elements.-->
        <p>Firefox sees this markup with 8 additional text nodes that are nothing but whitespace
            created by indenting.</p>

        <hr />
        <!--These extra text nodes create noise that makes it hard for your DOM-reading code to find
            the signal. In one browser, the first child of the body node might be a div. In another browser,
            the first child of the body might be an empty text node.-->
        <div
        ><p
        >There's not much to this.
        </p
        ><p
        >Nor to this.
        </p
        ></div
        >
        <!--This markup takes advantage of the fact that any carriage returns, tabs, and spaces that are
            enclosed in the < and the > of a tag are ignored by the browser. To the browser, < p > is the
            same as <p>. And...
            <
            div
            >
            ...is the same as <div>.-->
        <!--When whitespace is inside the brackets, the browser doesn't count it as a text node. So if
            you "hide" all carriage returns, tabs, and spaces inside the brackets as the code above does,
            there's no junk in the DOM. Any noise that would keep your JavaScript from reading the signal
            is removed.-->
        <!--Suppose you want to replace the text content of the second paragraph in a particular div
            with the string "All his men." Here's the markup, with the text we're going to change
            highlighted.-->
