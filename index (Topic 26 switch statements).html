            //Once again, the code that executes if the case is true is indented 2 spaces. (The universal convention is that it is indented
            // by some amount. Opinions differ on how much is best.

            //JavaScript has an inconvenient quirk: After a true case is found, JavaScript not only executes the statement(s) immediately
            // below that case. It executes all the statements for all the cases below it. So after a true case is found and the conditional
            // code executes, you need to jump out of the switch block by coding a break statement.

            //The keyword default works like else in an if...else statement. The code that follows it executes if none of the conditions
            // above it are met. There's no break statement in the default block. That's because default always comes last, which means
            // there are no statements below it to execute inappropriately.

            //In a switch statement, default code is optional, just as else code is optional after an if statement. Without the default
            // code, if none of the cases test true, nothing happens.

            //When there is no default code, careful coders include a break statement after the last condition anyway as insurance, even
            // though it may be superfluous. If you decide to add a new condition to the end later, you won't have to remember to add a break
            // to the block above it in order to avoid a disastrous cascade of statements.
