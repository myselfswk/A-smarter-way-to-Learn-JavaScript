            //JavaScript code doesn't care where it lives. It can be mixed in with—that is, embedded in —the HTML that creates a Web page. Or,
            // like an external CSS file, it can be placed in a separate file that is loaded by the HTML file. In most cases, it's best to
            // have an external JavaScript file, for some of the same reasons it's best to have an external CSS file. But you still need to
            // know how to place JavaScript within your HTML file, so let's start with that.

            //As you know, the order of HTML code is important, because it determines the order of elements on the page. If you want the
            // headline to appear above the text, you put the headlineabove the text in the HTML. But JavaScript doesn't work the same way.
            // All of your JavaScript functions, for example, are loaded into memory when the page loads. Wherever the code may be, the browser
            // finds it and stores it by the time the page is finished loading. Once the page is loaded, all the JavaScript code stays in
            // memory, ready to execute, for as long as the page is displayed.

            //You can legally put JavaScript code almost anywhere in the HTML file—in the head section, at the beginning of the body section,
            // somewhere in the middle of the body section, or at the end of the body section. You could, if you wanted to be perverse,
            // sprinkle different Javascript functions all over your HTMLfile in different places. The browser would sort it all out.

            //Generally, the best place for scripts, though, is at the end of the body section. This guarantees that CSS styling and image
            // display won't get held up while scripts are loading.

            //When you embed blocks of JavaScript in HTML (as opposed to having a separate JavaScript file), you must enclose the JavaScript
            // code between script opening and script closing tags. Here are two functions enclosed between the tags.

            function greet() {
                alert("Assalam-u-Alaikum, Waleed Here...!");
            }
            greet();

            //For most purposes, coders prefer to have all or most of their JavaScript code in a separate JavaScript file, then have the
            // browser load this external file at the same time it's loading the HTML file.

            //A JavaScript file is, like HTML and CSS files, a simple text file. It doesn't have a header or any other special sections. It
            // doesn't even have script opening and script closing tags. It's just pure JavaScript code.

            //You can include as many external JavaScript files as you like.
            //You can include JavaScript files and also embed other JavaScript code in the HTML.
