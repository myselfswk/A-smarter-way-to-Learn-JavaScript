        <!--if statement used in multiple statements/conditions-->
        <!--An if statement always begins with if. The space that separates it from the parenthesis is new to you. I've taught you to code alerts and
            prompts with the opening parenthesis running up against the keyword-->
        <!--The first line of an if statement ends with an opening curly bracket. An entire if statement ends with a closing curly bracket on its own line.
            Note that this is an exception to the rule that a statement ends with a semicolon. It's common to omit the semicolon when it's a complex statement
            that's paragraph-like and ends in a curly bracket.-->
        <!--Some coders write simple if statements without curly brackets, which is legal. Some put the opening curly bracket on its own line. Some put
            the whole if statement, if it's simple, on a single line-->
