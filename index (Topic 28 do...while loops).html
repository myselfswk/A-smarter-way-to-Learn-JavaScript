            //The differences between the two types of loops:
                //Instead of while, the keyword do leads off the statement.
                //The while clause, including the loop-limiting code inside the parentheses, moves to the bottom—after the closing curly
                // bracket.

            //Note that the while clause ends with a semicolon.
            //Functionally, the difference between a while loop and a do...while loop is that it's possible to code a while statement whose
            // block of instructions never execute. Consider this while loop.

            }
            //The code says to keep running an alert as long as the counter is less than 0. But since the counter is never less than 0,
            // the code inside the curly brackets never executes.

            //Compare this with the do...while loop.
            var i=0;
            do {
                alert(i);
                i++
            } while (i<0);

            //The alert will display once, even though the keep-going condition—i less than 0—never occurs. Since a do...while loop executes
            // the code inside the curly brackets before it gets to the loop-limiter at the bottom, it always executes that code at least
            // once, no matter what the looplimiter says.
