            <!--notice: onClick="alert('Hi');" The message inside the parens is
                surrounded by single quotes, not the double quotes we've been using for an alert string.-->
            <!--In JavaScript code, you aren't allowed to nest double quotes within double quotes or single quotes within single quotes-->
            <!--As an HTML coder, you're familiar with the beginning and end of this markup, <a href=""> & </a>
                But when the user clicks this link, it behaves differently than normal hyperlinks. Instead of
                taking the user to another page, or to a named anchor on the same page, it displays an alert
                saying "Assalam-u-Alaikum, Waleed Here..!".
            -->
            <!--Let's break it down.-->
                <!--When the user clicks the link, you don't want a new webpage to be loaded in this case, so,
                    instead of a URL, you place a # inside the quotation marks. This tells the browser to
                    reload the current page.-->
                <!--onClick= says, "When the button is clicked, execute the following JavaScript." onClick
                    isn't case-sensitive. You could write onclick, ONCLICK, or OnClIcK and it would work.
                    But the convention is onClick, so we'll stick with that.-->
                <!--A JavaScript statement (or more than one), enclosed in quotes, follows. When the user
                    clicks the link, it executes.-->
            <!--But there's a problem with the markup above. <a href="#" tells the browser to reload
                the page. This means that if the user has scrolled down to the link, the click, in addition to
                running the JavaScript code, will scroll the page back to the top—an action you don't normally
                want. I've included this flawed approach, using <a href="#", because you'll run into here and
                there in other people's work-->

            <!--there is no limit to the number of JavaScript statements that you can enclose in the quotation marks. No
                limit, that is, except for common sense. As you'll see, there are better ways to trigger
                JavaScript than packing multiple statements into an online onClick event.-->
