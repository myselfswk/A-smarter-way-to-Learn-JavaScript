            //Since you're asking for a number, and the user is presumably entering one, you might expect the math in the second statement to work.
            //For example, if the user enters 3, the variable tooManyCats should have a value of 4, you might think. But no such luck. All responses to
            //prompts come back as strings. When the string, "3", is linked with a plus to the number, 1, JavaScript converts the 1 to a string and
            //concatenates. So the value of tooManyCats winds up being not 4 but "31".

        <!--A prompt box asks the user for some information and provides a response field for her answer.-->
        <!--Prompt code is like alert code, with two differences.-->
        <!--In a prompt, you need a way to capture the user's response. That means you need to start by declaring a variable, followed by an equal sign.
            In a prompt, you can specify a second string. This is the default response that appears in the field when the prompt displays. If the user leaves
            the default response as-is and just clicks OK, the default response is assigned to the variable. It's up to you whether you include a default
            response.-->
        <!--Some coders write window.prompt instead of, simply, prompt. This is a highly formal but perfectly correct way to write it. Most coders
            prefer the short form.-->
