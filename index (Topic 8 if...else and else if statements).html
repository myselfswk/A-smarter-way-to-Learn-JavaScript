        <!--The if statements you've coded so far have been all-or-nothing. If the condition tested true, something happened. If the condition tested false,
            nothing happened.-->
        <!--There are so many ways to format if statements and their variations that the range of possibilities is almost endless. I'm partial to the format
            I've showed you, because it's easy to learn and produces readable code. I'll ask you to stick to this format throughout the exercises.-->
