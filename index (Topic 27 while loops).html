            //A while loop does the same thing as for loop, but it's organized differently. Only the middle term, how long to keep the loop 
            // going, is inside the parentheses. The counter is defined before the first line of the while block. The counter is updated within
            // the code that executes when the loop runs.

            var i=0;
            while (i<=3) {
                alert(i);
                i++;
            }

            //In other ways, a while loop is organized along the same lines as a for loop.
                //Parentheses enclose the loop limiter.
                //Curly brackets enclose the code that executes.
                //The code that executes is indented 2 spaces.

            //Since, any for loop can be translated into a while loop and vice versa, you can use whichever one you prefer.
