            //commenting help you and others understand your code when it comes time to revise. You can also use commenting to comment out
            // portions of your code for testing and debugging. Since, compared with HTML or CSS, JavaScript is typically harder to
            // understand when you come back to it later, you may want to put extra effort into commenting your JS code, especially if you're
            // working in a team or if someone else may be asked to maintain your code in the future.

        <h1>Commenting</h1>
        <p>Commenting, as you know from your work with HTML and CSS, is a way to tell the
            browser to ignore certain portions of text that you include within the body of code. Comments
            are for the human, not the machine.</p>
        <!--In HTMLthere's only one way to mark text as a comment. You write [(< !--)together] to open and --
            > to close. And in CSS there's only one way to mark text as a comment. You write /* to open
            and */ to close. In Javascript, there are two ways mark text as a comment.
            The two slashes(//)"Everything from here to the end of this line is a comment." You can write as many lines of comments as you like.
            When you comment with slashes, there's no closing tag, because the end of the line closes the comment automatically.
