        <h1>Variables</h1>
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <!--A variable is created when you write var (for variable) followed by the name that you choose to give it. It takes on a particular value when you
            assign the value to it. This is a JavaScript statement that creates the variable name and assigns the value "some value" to it.-->
        <!--JavaScript's blindness to meaning notwithstanding, when it comes to variable names, you'll want to give your variables meaningful names,
            because it'll help you and other coders understand your code.
            Again, the syntactic difference between variables and text strings is that variables are never enclosed in quotes, and text strings are always
            enclosed in quotes-->
        <!--Unlike a string, a number is not enclosed in quotes. That's how JavaScript knows it's a number that it can do math on and not a text string,
            like a ZIP code, that it handles as text.-->
        <!--A variable name can't contain any spaces.
            A variable name can contain only letters, numbers, dollar signs, and underscores.
            Though a variable name can't be any of JavaScript's keywords, it can contain keywords. For example, userAlert and myVar are legal.-->
